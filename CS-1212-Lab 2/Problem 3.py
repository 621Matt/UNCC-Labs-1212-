# Problem 3
# Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height
# of right-angled triangle and prints the area. 
# The area of a right angled-triangle is  1/2 x base x height 
print("Enter Base of right-angled triangle:")
base1 = input("Base: ")
height1 = input("Height: ")
area = .5 * int(base1) * int(height1)
print("Area is: ", area)
