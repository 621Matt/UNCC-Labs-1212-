# Problem 4
#In lab03_p4.py you are given another problematic code that runs but doesnâ€™t give the expected result. The code should prompt the user for two numbers, calculate and display their sum. Explain what changes need to be made to make this code behave as expected and make those changes.

num1 = float(input('Enter a number: ')) #Change num to num1 and num2 so that the program does not overwrite the variables

num2 = float(input('Enter a number: ')) #Add a ) to this line 

sum = num1 + num2 #Also fix the num variables here

print("The sum of the two numbers you have entered is:", sum) #Add "" to beginning of The and is: DONE
